# Intention Repeater Max

Written in C++, this is the successor to the original Intention Repeater, written in Python.

It repeats your intention up to 100+PHz, to make things happen.

You probably want intention_repeater_max.cpp if you are on Linux,
and intention_repeater_max.exe if you are on Windows.

To compile, g++ is faster (by a little), but I prefer clang++ because it has a cooler name.

Be sure to check out the clang-format utility to format your code to industry standards.

To compile your code: clang++ -O3 -Wall -static ./intention_repeater_max.cpp -o ./intention_repeater_max

Please see the Example .cpp files for the basics of Multiplying Intention in memory, and to a file.

To edit code I recommend Visual Studio Code.

To format the code, and beautify it, I recommend clang-format.

Special thanks to Karteek Sheri for providing the benchmarking and performance enhancement.
